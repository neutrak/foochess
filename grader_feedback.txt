Your code is really good.  Everything basically works right.  But you've added in things that are totally unneccessary and useless.  

//For example, you were explicitly told in the last assignment that only the player who is moving can possibly be in checkmate.  The player who isn't currently at move can't possibly even be in check, so that whole first if statement in your minmaxpruning function is never true.  Get rid of it.  

//Also, when counting pieces, the two kings are guaranteed to always be on the board, so there's no point in giving them point values to add to the sum.  

//Also on the check note, in your informed_points heuristic, the player who is making the move to the new state you're evaluating can't be in check.  That would make it an illegal move.  So you don't need the !get_check(player_id) at all.  

Your different heuristics for the bonus are decent.  Not exactly revolutionary compared to the original point value heuristic, but it is an improvement it seems.  I think you could expand on it even more to make it very good.  

//You had a note in your readme about checkmates at different depths.  I agree with the idea of stopping at the current depth if you find a guaranteed checkmate, but if you've found multiple paths for which minimax has found you putting your opponent in checkmate, then all of those paths are guaranteed to lead to checkmate, and it really doesn't matter which one you follow.  

Last note, you seem to have left your debugging output statements on, so the terminal is just spewing text while your algorithm runs.
