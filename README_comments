A few notes about this program at a high abstraction level.  

  I made a Board class that stores a game state and has data to be a tree node later.  
  I modified AI to add a few functions and to call the new functions and board class as needed.  
  I made a _SuperPiece struct to hold some additional data for pieces (like movements).  
  I do an integrity check on every move I get from the server to ensure the master board in the AI class is never incorrect.  
  In order to count movements, the AI class stores the aforementioned "master" board throughout its life.
